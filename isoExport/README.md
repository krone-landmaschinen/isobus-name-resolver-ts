# ISO Export

In order to build the isobus-name resolver, an export of ISOBUS Parameters from [isobus.net](http://isobus.net/isobus/)
(direct download link [here](https://www.isobus.net/isobus/attachments/isoExport_csv.zip)) has to be downloaded and extracted here.

**This is automatically done in the build process by the github action**
